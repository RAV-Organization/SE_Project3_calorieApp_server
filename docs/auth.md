# Two-Factor Authentication Implementation README

## Overview

This implementation provides a basic Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) mechanism for user registration in a Flask web application. The code includes two main components:

1. **`send_2fa_email` function:**
   - Sends a Two-Factor Authentication code to the user's provided email address.
   - Uses Gmail's SMTP server for sending emails.

2. **`verify_2fa` route:**
   - Renders a form for users to enter the 2FA code sent to their email.
   - Validates the entered code against the stored one in the session.
   - If the code is correct, it proceeds with user registration.

## Configuration

Before using this implementation, make sure to configure the following parameters in the code:

- `sender`: Email address from which the 2FA code will be sent.
- `password`: App-specific password for the sender's email account.
- `receiver`: Variable representing the user's email address.

**Note:** Ensure that your email provider supports sending emails using SMTP and that you have allowed less secure apps to access your email account (for Gmail, this can be configured in your account security settings).

## Dependencies

This implementation uses the following Python libraries:

- `flask`: A web framework for building the application.
- `smtplib`: Provides an interface for sending emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
- `ssl`: Used for creating SSL contexts for secure communication.
- `email.message.EmailMessage`: A class for creating email messages.
