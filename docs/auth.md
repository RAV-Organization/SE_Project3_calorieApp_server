# Two-Factor Authentication Implementation README

## Overview

This implementation provides a basic Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) mechanism for user registration in a Flask web application. The code includes two main components:

1. **`send_2fa_email` function:**
   - Sends a Two-Factor Authentication code to the user's provided email address.
   - Uses Gmail's SMTP server for sending emails.

2. **`verify_2fa` route:**
   - Renders a form for users to enter the 2FA code sent to their email.
   - Validates the entered code against the stored one in the session.
   - If the code is correct, it proceeds with user registration.
