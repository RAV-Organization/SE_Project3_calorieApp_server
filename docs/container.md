# Containers

## Dockerize
  Step 1: Run
  `docker compose up -d`
  (with and optional --build option at the end if you have already done the build and to build again)

  No need to manually populate the data as in the steps above. The docker config takes care of that :)

  Step 2: Open the URL in your browser:  
      http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or http://localhost:5000/
