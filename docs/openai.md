# OpenAI Chat Integration

This code integrates OpenAI's GPT-3 model into a Flask web application, allowing users to engage in a chat-like interaction with the model. The user provides prompts, and the application sends these prompts to the GPT-3 engine, retrieving responses for display.

## Functionality

1. **API Key Setup:**
   - The OpenAI API key needs to be provided in the `openai.api_key` variable at the beginning of the code. This key is essential for authenticating requests to the OpenAI API.

2. **Chat Interaction:**
   - Users can enter prompts in a form on the web page.
   - On form submission, the application sends the prompt to the OpenAI GPT-3 engine using the `get_completion` function.
   - The GPT-3 engine processes the prompt and returns a completion.
   - The completion is displayed on the web page.

3. **Chat Interface:**
   - The web page includes a form where users can input their prompts.
   - The prompts are sent to the server using a POST request.
   - The server communicates with the OpenAI GPT-3 engine and receives a response.
   - The user's prompt and the GPT-3 response are displayed on the page in a chat-like format.

4. **Asynchronous Interaction:**
   - The web page dynamically updates with the user's prompt and the model's response without requiring a page reload.
   - The asynchronous interaction provides a seamless chat experience.
